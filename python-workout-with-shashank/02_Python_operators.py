#======== Arithmetic Operators

a = 10
b = 3

print("value of a:",a)
print("value of b:",b)
print("addition of a & b =",a+b)
print("substraction of a & b =",a-b)
print("multiplication of a & b =",a*b)
print("normal division of a & b =",a/b)
print("Integer division of a & b =",a//b)
print("remainder or mode of a & b =",a%b)

# ====== EXPONENT

print("the power of 2^10 =" , 2**a)
print("the power of 10^2 =" , a**2)


#============ Comparison Operators

print("Equal of a == b :",a==b)
print("Not Equal of a != b:",a!=b)
print("Less than or Equal of a <= b =",a<=b)
print("greater than or Equal of a >= b =",a>=b)
print("Greater than of a > b =",a>b)
print("Lesser Than of a < b =",a<b)
